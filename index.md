# Github Flavored Markdown Syntax Simple Guide

## Comments
> You can add comment to markdown by three ways like below:

**Syntax One:**
``` markdown
[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
[comment]: <> (in the output file unless you use it in)
[comment]: <> (a reference style link.)
```

**Syntax Two:**
``` markdown
[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)
```

**Syntax Three: _(Recommend)_**
``` markdown
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
```
neither
``` markdown
[//]: # "This may be the most platform independent comment"
```

## Horizontal lines
> A line consisting of 0-3 spaces of indentation, followed by a sequence of three or more matching -, _, or * characters, each followed optionally by any number of spaces.

**Syntax:**
``` markdown
